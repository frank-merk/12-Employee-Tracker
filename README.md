## Overview

This application MySQL, Node.js, inquirer, figlet, and more to create a command line employee management dashboard.

## Installation

To install, first make sure you have the dependencies (in this MySQL, inquirer, figlet):

`npm install`

You will also need to populate the database in SQL Workbench using the schema and seeds in the 'db' directory.

To run the application from the terminal, you will enter:

`node server.js`

## Strategy

My goal was to follow file structure best practices to stay organized. There is a lot of material that makes up this project, from multiple inquirer prompt calls, to the database itself, as well as managing connections. I feel good about how my database structure turned out, and I really took a lot of time to play around to see what would work best in terms of structure.

## Challenges

I need more time to focus on MySQL with my tutor because I was absent from class for the week we covered most of these topics. I've reviewed the materials, but it's been tough to catch up. I specifically need to review the CRUD topics and the connection topics to iron out my syntax and figure out data flow between node and MySQL
